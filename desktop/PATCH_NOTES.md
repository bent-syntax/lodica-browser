# Patch notes

## 1.6.2
- The search box on the home screen uses the search engine chosen in Settings.
- Desktop notifications for a new browser version and for new messages while the chat is closed (checked every 5 minutes).
- Server chat has private chats with one device and group chats. Use "+" in the chat header; right-click a chat tab to remove it. Messages in other chats are kept apart from the shared room.

## 1.6.1
- New look. Settings has an icon sidebar and rows grouped in rounded cards, toggles and chips animate, theme tiles no longer show an oval selection ring, dialogs and sheets have softer corners and shadows, the tab switcher cards lift on hover, and the Server chat menu entry has its own icon.

## 1.6.0
- Typing in the Lodica Search box now uses the search engine chosen in Settings. Lodica Search is only used when it is the chosen engine.
- Lodica Search keeps its results, the AI answer and your scroll position when you go back from a page, instead of searching again. Results appear before the theme and AI state arrive.
- Server chat and the in-page search link handling from 1.5.2 are included.
- The Android-only changes of this release (settings redesign, authenticator, setup entry points) are not in the desktop app.

## 1.5.2
- Server chat: one shared room for everyone linked to the same server (menu > Server chat; needs the updated relay). Messages are not end-to-end encrypted and are kept 24 hours.
- Typing a link into the in-page search bar opens it directly instead of searching.
- The Android-only items of this release (authenticator, sign-in tracking-protection pause, server-offline fallback, address bar, tab switcher) are not in the desktop app yet.

## 1.5.1
- Android: "Own domain names" is more forgiving. It accepts "name target", "name=target", "name, target", "name -> target", hosts-file order ("192.168.1.10 nas.home") and "# comments". Before, any line that did not match exactly two space-separated words was dropped without a message.
- Android: saving a custom DNS server now also re-applies DNS over HTTPS mode in the running browser.
- Desktop has no own-DNS feature, so nothing changed there. Only the version number moved to stay in step.
- Not tested on a real device. I could not reproduce the original failure, so this fixes the likely causes.

## 1.5.0
Desktop and Android now share the same version number.
- Desktop: the start page background no longer shows only half. The header is transparent on the home page.
- Desktop: add a start page shortcut straight from the page, no edit mode needed. Hover a shortcut to remove it.
- Desktop: "Hide automatic shortcuts" moved into Settings > Start page shortcuts.
- Desktop: picking an image or gradient background shows a preview before you apply it. Images you used before are kept in a gallery, and you can remove them from it.
- Desktop: vertical tabs show only the site icon by default. Drag the divider wider to see full tab titles, narrower to go back to icons.
- Android: you choose what each gesture does (edge swipes, four-finger swipes, address bar swipes) in Settings > Controls, with a reset button.
- Desktop keybinds were already editable in Settings > Keybinds & controls.
- Not tested on a real device. The Windows build is untested.

## 1.3.0
- Built-in PDF viewer (desktop). PDF links and PDF files open in a clean viewer with no ads. It is pdf.js, the same viewer Firefox uses.
  - Draw, write text, highlight and add signatures with the toolbar buttons, then save the edited copy.
  - Pass a .pdf path on the command line, or click any link to a .pdf, to open it.
  - Only links ending in .pdf are caught. A PDF served from a URL without .pdf still opens in the normal Chromium viewer.
- Android: no change yet. Firefox's own PDF viewer in GeckoView is used. Editing there is not checked on a device.
- Not tested on a real device yet.
- Still to come: Chromium/Firefox engine switch, desktop-site mobile mode.

## 1.2.0
- Extensions. Settings > General > Extensions.
  - Desktop: paste a Chrome Web Store link or extension ID to install it. Electron supports only part of the Chrome extension API, so some extensions will not work fully.
  - Android: search Firefox Add-ons and install with one tap. You see the permissions first.
  - Turn extensions on or off, or remove them, in the same place.
- Not tested on a real device yet. Firefox add-ons cannot run on desktop, and the Chrome Web Store cannot be used on Android.
- Still to come: Chromium/Firefox engine switch, built-in PDF editor, desktop-site mobile mode.

## 1.1.0
- Search home page: add your own quick-access sites, remove any tile, and turn off the automatic "most visited" tiles.
- Search page now uses your browser theme.
- Search box has a clear (X) button.
- Make your own theme (four colours) with a live preview. It syncs to your other devices.
- "Use dummy mail" appears only on sign-up pages. You can hide it for a specific site.
- The two dark-mode settings are now one ("Dark pages").
- Search works without a server (falls back to DuckDuckGo).
- Android: the home-screen search widget follows your theme and has its own hint text and shape.
- Not done yet: Chromium/Firefox engine switch, extension store, built-in PDF editor, desktop-site mobile mode.
