# Patch notes

## 1.5.2
- Server chat: one shared room for everyone linked to the same server (menu > Server chat; needs the updated relay). Messages are not end-to-end encrypted and are kept 24 hours.
- Typing a link into the in-page search bar opens it directly instead of searching.
- The Android-only items of this release (authenticator, sign-in tracking-protection pause, server-offline fallback, address bar, tab switcher) are not in the desktop app yet.

## 1.5.1
- Android: "Own domain names" is more forgiving. It accepts "name target", "name=target", "name, target", "name -> target", hosts-file order ("192.168.1.10 nas.home") and "# comments". Before, any line that did not match exactly two space-separated words was dropped without a message.
- Android: saving a custom DNS server now also re-applies DNS over HTTPS mode in the running browser.
- Desktop has no own-DNS feature, so nothing changed there. Only the version number moved to stay in step.
- Not tested on a real device. I could not reproduce the original failure, so this fixes the likely causes.

## 1.5.0
Desktop and Android now share the same version number.
- Desktop: the start page background no longer shows only half. The header is transparent on the home page.
- Desktop: add a start page shortcut straight from the page, no edit mode needed. Hover a shortcut to remove it.
- Desktop: "Hide automatic shortcuts" moved into Settings > Start page shortcuts.
- Desktop: picking an image or gradient background shows a preview before you apply it. Images you used before are kept in a gallery, and you can remove them from it.
- Desktop: vertical tabs show only the site icon by default. Drag the divider wider to see full tab titles, narrower to go back to icons.
- Android: you choose what each gesture does (edge swipes, four-finger swipes, address bar swipes) in Settings > Controls, with a reset button.
- Desktop keybinds were already editable in Settings > Keybinds & controls.
- Not tested on a real device. The Windows build is untested.

## 1.3.0
- Built-in PDF viewer (desktop). PDF links and PDF files open in a clean viewer with no ads. It is pdf.js, the same viewer Firefox uses.
  - Draw, write text, highlight and add signatures with the toolbar buttons, then save the edited copy.
  - Pass a .pdf path on the command line, or click any link to a .pdf, to open it.
  - Only links ending in .pdf are caught. A PDF served from a URL without .pdf still opens in the normal Chromium viewer.
- Android: no change yet. Firefox's own PDF viewer in GeckoView is used. Editing there is not checked on a device.
- Not tested on a real device yet.
- Still to come: Chromium/Firefox engine switch, desktop-site mobile mode.

## 1.2.0
- Extensions. Settings > General > Extensions.
  - Desktop: paste a Chrome Web Store link or extension ID to install it. Electron supports only part of the Chrome extension API, so some extensions will not work fully.
  - Android: search Firefox Add-ons and install with one tap. You see the permissions first.
  - Turn extensions on or off, or remove them, in the same place.
- Not tested on a real device yet. Firefox add-ons cannot run on desktop, and the Chrome Web Store cannot be used on Android.
- Still to come: Chromium/Firefox engine switch, built-in PDF editor, desktop-site mobile mode.

## 1.1.0
- Search home page: add your own quick-access sites, remove any tile, and turn off the automatic "most visited" tiles.
- Search page now uses your browser theme.
- Search box has a clear (X) button.
- Make your own theme (four colours) with a live preview. It syncs to your other devices.
- "Use dummy mail" appears only on sign-up pages. You can hide it for a specific site.
- The two dark-mode settings are now one ("Dark pages").
- Search works without a server (falls back to DuckDuckGo).
- Android: the home-screen search widget follows your theme and has its own hint text and shape.
- Not done yet: Chromium/Firefox engine switch, extension store, built-in PDF editor, desktop-site mobile mode.
